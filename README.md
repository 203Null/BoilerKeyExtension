# BoilerKeyExtension
This is a Chrome extension that circumvents BoilerKey. The code is based heavily off of u/elnardu's [python script](https://github.com/elnardu/local-boilerkey).

To install, navigate to chrome://extensions in Google Chrome, enable developer options, click "Load unpacked", and select this project's directory. After that, navigate to Purdue's CAS login page, and follow the instructions for the first-time setup.
